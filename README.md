# Computational Cookbook

## Designing Educational Experiences with Jupyter Notebooks:

### Abstract:
Poor documentation leads to poor understanding of a software. It is difficult to interpret other researchers' code without unequivocal documentation. *Jupyter Notebook* combines code and rich-text elements which allows the user to *effectively learn, modify and run the notebook*. Hence, we offer an example of notebooks for NCBI computational resource that is *Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)*. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is a tool used to align sequences and find regions of similarity between them. This notebook teaches how to *run a BLAST search from within BioPython* and how to *compare and identify* unknown user provided biological sequences. 

### Dependencies:
* Python 3 (packages such as BioPython, Macplotlib, Pandas)
* Jupyter Notebook

### Example user persona:
User persona is written to accompolish the design of notebook, and help people learn, modify the notebook, and scale to larger problems:

Sarah, an undergrad student (major biology) is taking one unit of web-based bioinformatics, and has little programming experience. She has to solve the following assignment:

The goal is to determine if a recently-obtained genomic sequence from Drosophila yakuba (a
relative of the model fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster) contains region(s) with sequence
similarity to any known genes. The unknown sequence is an 11,000 base pair (bp) fragment of
genomic DNA, and the objective of gene annotation is to find and precisely map the coding
regions of any genes in this part of the genome.

### Usage:
Method (text & code)

### Project Team:

Designing Educational Experiences with Jupyter Notebook was developed at NCBI-Hackathons, from August 14-August 16, 2017
